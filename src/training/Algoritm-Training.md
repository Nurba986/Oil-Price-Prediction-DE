Create modular functions
Make pipeline classes
Add error handling
Include logging

# 1. Create Prediction Pipeline:
## prediction_pipeline.py
def make_prediction():
    # Load trained model
    model = load_model('models/xgboost_best.pkl')
    
    # Make prediction
    future_prediction = model.predict(future_features)
    
    # Log results
    logging.info(f"Prediction for next period: {future_prediction}")
    
    # Save/Send results
    save_predictions(future_prediction)

# 2. Output Options:

def handle_results(predictions):
    # Save to CSV/Database
    save_to_csv(predictions, 'predictions.csv')
    
    # Send email notification
    send_email(
        subject="WTI Price Prediction Ready",
        body=f"Predicted price: ${predictions[0]:.2f}"
    )
    
    # API response
    return {"predicted_price": predictions[0]}


# 3 Email Notification Content:

Subject: WTI Price Prediction Update

Prediction Details:
- Forecasted Price: $XX.XX
- Confidence Level: XX%
- Prediction Period: Next 12 months
- Model Performance Metrics: RMSE: XX.XX

Key Insights:
- Trend Direction: Up/Down
- Major Factors: [Key Features]


ML Preparation Notes:

First 6 months will have NaN values due to rolling window
Consider dropping first 12 months for consistent training
Scale features before training (except date)
Recommended train/test split: by date
Consider validation set between 2018-2020
